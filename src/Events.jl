    Events

HTTP/2 event system for connection and stream lifecycle management.

This module defines the event types that represent various HTTP/2 protocol
events such as requests, responses, data transfers, settings changes, and
connection management. Events are used to communicate protocol state changes
between different components of the HTTP/2 implementation.

The event system provides:
- Type-safe event definitions for all HTTP/2 protocol events
- Automatic timestamp tracking for debugging and monitoring
- Validation of protocol-specific constraints
- Stream and connection lifecycle management
